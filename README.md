## Usage

*(This section is a placeholder. Please replace it with instructions on how to run and use your project.)*

If this is a command-line tool, you might show how to run it:

```bash
# Example:
# node src/index.js --inputFile data/input.json --rules pricing-rules.js
```

If this is a library, you could provide a code example:

```javascript
/*
const pricingCalc = require('./src/main');

const options = {
  // ... your options here
};

const finalPrice = pricingCalc.calculate(options);
console.log(`The final price is: ${finalPrice}`);
*/
```

## Features

Based on the dependencies, your project likely includes features such as:

- Advanced string and pattern matching for rules (`micromatch`, `is-glob`).
- Robust handling of numerical ranges and inputs (`to-regex-range`, `fill-range`, `is-number`).
- Resilient asynchronous operations with retry logic (`@humanwhocodes/retry`).

## Dependencies

This project relies on several open-source packages, including `micromatch`, `braces`, `@humanwhocodes/retry`, and others to provide its functionality.
